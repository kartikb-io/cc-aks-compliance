# 3. Reports

## Built in Report Types

With the policy portion of securing our application compelete, we need a way to report that our application is in compliance going forward. Using the reporting feature of Calico Cloud we can create a number of reports to satisfy the various PCI DSS and SOC 2 reporting requirements.

Calico Cloud supports the following built-in report types:

- Inventory
- Network Access
- Policy-Audit
- CIS Benchmark

These reports can be customized to report against a certain set of endpoints (for example PCI endpoints).

## Example Reports

### Weekly Report - All Endpoints

The following report schedules weekly inventory reports for all endpoints. The jobs that create the reports will run on the infrastructure nodes (e.g. nodetype == ‘infrastructure’).

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: weekly-full-infrastructure-inventory
spec:
  reportType: inventory
  schedule: 0 0 * * 0
  jobNodeSelector:
    nodetype: infrastructure
```

### Daily Report - Endpoints in Selected Namespace

The following report schedules daily network-access reports for the accounts department with endpoints specified using a namespace selector.

```yaml
apiVersion: projectcalico.org/v3
kind: GlobalReport
metadata:
  name: daily-accounts-networkaccess
spec:
  reportType: network-access
  endpoints:
    namespaces:
      selector: department == 'accounts'
  schedule: 0 0 * * *
```

## Known Limitations

CIS Benchmark support on cloud providers.
